Get the root node and set to the first color in the domain of colors

for each color in the domain, make a recursive call to the depth first search method and pass in current

    if current.next is null (AKA at the leaf node in the tree)
        check for conflicts
            if there is a conflict then return
            else, create an arraylist of the solution and return
